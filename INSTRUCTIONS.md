# Hands-on instructions

This repository contains the boilerplate of a Web page. The domain is not implemented, but there are some hints on what to do:

- inspect the `index.html` to familiarize with the page structure;
- check the docstrings on each `.js` file;
- don't worry about `style.css`.

You're supposed to implement the Web page so that the requirements are fulfilled.

1. use the native `fetch` API to implement the `request.js` function;
2. implement the dynamic listing in `listFIller.js`;
3. make `"select"` events be the trigger of the behavior in `onselect.js`.
